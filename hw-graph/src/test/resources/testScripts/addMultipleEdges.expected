# test that multiple edges can be added to the graph and they will not affect to each other

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a pair of nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1

# Add an edge
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1
graph1 contains: n1 n2
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1)

# Add a pair of nodes
added node n3 to graph1
added node n4 to graph1

# Add another edge
added edge e2 from n3 to n4 in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n3
graph1 contains: n1 n2 n3 n4
the children of n3 in graph1 are: n4(e2)

# Add another edge
added edge e3 from n1 to n3 in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1
graph1 contains: n1 n2 n3 n4
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1) n3(e3)
