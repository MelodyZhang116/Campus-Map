# test that multiple edges can be added to two graphs and they will not affect each other.

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a pair of nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1

# Add an edge
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1
graph1 contains: n1 n2
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1)

# Create another graph
created graph graph2

# Add a pair of nodes
added node n3 to graph2
added node n4 to graph2

# Add another edge
added edge e2 from n3 to n4 in graph2

# Print the nodes in the graph2 and the outgoing edges from n3
graph2 contains: n3 n4
the children of n3 in graph2 are: n4(e2)

# Print the nodes in the graph1 and the outgoing edges from n1, to make sure that
# edge in graph1 is not affected by the edge in graph2
graph1 contains: n1 n2
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1)
