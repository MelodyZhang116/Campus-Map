# test that add node to the graph will not create incorrect behavior to other graph.

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a node
added node n1 to graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph
graph1 contains: n1

# Create another graph
created graph graph2

# Add a node to the second graph
added node n2 to graph2

# Print the nodes in the second graph
graph2 contains: n2

# Print the nodes in the first graph again to make sure it is still correct
graph1 contains: n1
