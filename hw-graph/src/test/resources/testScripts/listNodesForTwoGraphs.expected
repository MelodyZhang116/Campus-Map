# test that nodes (from two graphs) can be listed correctly. test whether the nodes in
# one graph listed can have effect on other graph.

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a node to graph1
added node n1 to graph1

# Add a node to graph1
added node n2 to graph1

# List the nodes in the graph1
graph1 contains: n1 n2

# Create another graph
created graph graph2

# Add a node to the second graph
added node n3 to graph2

# Add a node to the second graph
added node n4 to graph2

# List the nodes in the second graph
graph2 contains: n3 n4

# List the nodes in the first graph again to make sure it is still correct
graph1 contains: n1 n2
