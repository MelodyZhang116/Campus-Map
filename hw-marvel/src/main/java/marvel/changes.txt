Briefly list any changes you made to your graph class during hw-marvel, and why you made those changes.


I change the method insertEdge. Before change, it threw exception if child or parent does not exist.
After change, it will automatically build child node or parent node if they do not exist.

I add two method get(String parent) and get(Node parent). Their function is the same is get(Object o)
in the map.

I add one method allEdge that return all edges of graph.

I changed the return type of listChildren to a list of edges.
