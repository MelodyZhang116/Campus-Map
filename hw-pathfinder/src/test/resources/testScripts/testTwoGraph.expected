# test two graphs so that they affect each other

created graph complexGraph

added node A to complexGraph
added node B to complexGraph
added node C to complexGraph
added node D to complexGraph
added node E to complexGraph

added edge 1.000 from A to B in complexGraph
added edge 100.000 from B to E in complexGraph
added edge 50.000 from C to D in complexGraph
added edge 1.000 from D to E in complexGraph
added edge 20.000 from A to C in complexGraph

path from A to E:
A to C with weight 20.000
C to D with weight 50.000
D to E with weight 1.000
total cost: 71.000
