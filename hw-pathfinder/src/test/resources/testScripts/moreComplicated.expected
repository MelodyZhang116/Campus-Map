# includes a more complicated graph to test whether it can find the shortest path

created graph complexGraph

added node A to complexGraph
added node B to complexGraph
added node C to complexGraph
added node D to complexGraph
added node E to complexGraph

added edge 1.000 from A to B in complexGraph
added edge 100.000 from B to E in complexGraph
added edge 50.000 from C to D in complexGraph
added edge 1.000 from D to E in complexGraph

path from A to E:
C to D with weight 50.000
D to E with weight 2.000
total cost: 52.000
