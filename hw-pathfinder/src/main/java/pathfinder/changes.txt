Briefly list any changes you made to your graph class during hw-pathfinder, and why you made those changes.
I make it generic because it is required.

I remove the IllegalArgumentException in insertNode method because I want it do nothing if the node
already in graph. In dataset there are nodes inserted that are duplicates. To ensure that the program
can run, I insert the node if the node does not exist, do nothing if the node exist.

I remove the checking of duplicates in insertEdge method because it takes so long time. Instead, I put
a @spec.requires at the top of that method, requiring the added edge does not exist before inserting.

I changed the returned type of list children so that it no longer in sorting order. Sorting is in graphtestdriver.
Because the algorithm in hw 7 does not require it in the normal way of sorting.
