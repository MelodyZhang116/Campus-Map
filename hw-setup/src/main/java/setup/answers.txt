1. Why did Fibonacci fail the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException< test? What (if anything) did
you have to do to fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

It said that 0 is nonnegative, so problems may happen when n is 0. I delete the = in the n<=0.

2. Why did Fibonacci fail the testBaseCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to fix
it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

It is the issue with base case. So problem should happen if n <= 0, which is the same as testThrosIllegalArgumentException.
So if I fix the first problem, I can fix the second one.

3.Why did Fibonacci fail the testInductiveCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to
fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

For index2, it should return 2, because the list should be 1,1,2,.. But it return 1, so there might be problem with n <= 2.
When n = 2, it should not return 1. It should go to index 0 +index 1. So I delete the = in the n <=2. Also, it should be index0 + index1, with a plus sign.
