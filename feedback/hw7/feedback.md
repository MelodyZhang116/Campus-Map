### Design: 2/3

- Generic Model Interface
The `ModelAPI` should not expose any graph specific implementation details,
since ideally our graph implementation should be able to be swapped out for some
other backend, like a table of shortest paths, or a `Google Maps` client.
  
### Documentation & Specification (including JavaDoc): 3/3

- Your CampusMap constructor specification doesn't provide enough 
  information to the client.

- Your type variables should be documented.

### Code quality (code and internal comments including RI/AF when appropriate): 3/3

### Testing (test suite quality & implementation): 3/3

### Mechanics: 3/3
